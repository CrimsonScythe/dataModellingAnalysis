# mini projects showing basic data modelling and analysis techniques including PCA, linear regression and hypothesis testing

## A1: Basic linear regression in python using standard numpy functions.
## A2: Regularized linear regression (helps prevent overfitting) in python using standard numpy functions.
## A5: classification techniques on the infamous iris dataset, using k-means clustering and random forests in Python. Also uses PCA to reduce dataset dimensionality.
## src: PCA visualizations and implementation of multivariate principles in Python.
